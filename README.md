Coming start of school :)

Some code I wrote to vastly improve the Miami Country Day School student portal.
This is a side project of mine that I occasionally work on, so updates may be infrequent.
This is not officially endorsed by MCDS, and things may break.

> [!NOTE]
> Since MyCountryDay runs on Blackbaud these scripts might work on other Blackbaud school sites.

Have any suggestions? Bugs? Hmu on Snap `aosceola56` or on Discord `datgamer56`

## Features

- Dark Mode
- Ultrawide Mode (for large screens, experimental)
- Better messages page
- Various QOL tweaks (i.e. Classes are in order by track, etc)
- Overall site cleanup
- Security improvements
- ...more coming soon!

# Coming soon
- Custom Profiles
- Themes?

> [!NOTE]
> Dark mode (and by extension, custom themes that I may implement) will never be perfect. <br />
> Many people have access to menus which I never will, and thus won't be able to change. (Ex: parents, teachers, athletes, etc) <br />
> While I have tried to make dark mode the best as I can get it, there will still be pages that won't be affected. <br />
> Additionally, recent site changes (ex: the Assignment Center) will be broken until I fix them shortly after the year begins. <br />
> If you have any menus or areas that haven't been working on dark mode, please reach out to me! <br />
