# MCDTweaks by Anthony Osceola
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/80vbdjR/mcdtweaks.png">
Coming start of school :)

Some code I wrote to vastly improve the Miami Country Day School student portal.
This is a side project of mine that I occasionally work on, so updates may be infrequent.
This is not officially endorsed by MCDS, and things may break.

Have any suggestions? Bugs? Hmu on Snap `aosceola56` or on Discord `datgamer56`

## Features

- Dark Mode
- Ultrawide Mode (for large screens, experimental)
- Better messages page
- Various QOL tweaks (i.e. Classes are in order by track, etc)
- Overall site cleanup
- ...more coming soon!

### In progress
- Form auto-sign
